<h1>Browser-History-Collection-Application</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hi, I am a final year CS undergraduate. I am working on my fianl year project this year.
For my final year project, I am building a tool to aid PC users to use their OWN browser history 
to aid them in looking back through their history for things they have seen, etc. 
This will be a tool to help people research and learn things online.</p>

<p> I like to think of it as a way to ease the pressure and mistakes of a users biological RAM,
  when researching things online. It sucks forgetting where you saw something. 
  Hopefully this tool will help with that </p>
  
 <h2>What do I need from you?</h2>
 
 <p>I want autonomous browser history <b>from students, researchers, or anyone that uses the 
  internet to learn.</b I want browser history where you are actively researching something.></p>
  
  <h2>What do I not want from you?</h2>
  
  <p>I dont want browser history from when you where searching through youtube, or facebook, or ... anything weird...</p>
  <p>I dont want any personal data.</p> 
  <p>I dont want to use this data to do some kind of marketing or psychological analysis of you.</p>

<h2>What is this project</h1>

<p>This python project takes is not my final year project. This is a tool to help me gather browser history data.</p>
